Exploratory Analysis :
Designed measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for KPIs  
Created ratios such as Wage to Overall rating, Age Groups, Performance Classes  
Implemented filters to highlight key patterns  

Interactive Visualizations :
Bar, Column, Line, and Pie charts for comparisons and trends  
KPI cards for quick overview of performance  
Slicers for filtering data dynamically  
Drill through pages for detailed analysis at individual level  

Dashboard Design :
Built a single page executive dashboard summarizing all key insights  
Used a clean professional color theme for readability
