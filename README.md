# üìä Excel Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization** using Microsoft Excel.  
It focuses on extracting meaningful insights from raw data through **pivot tables, charts, and dashboarding techniques**.

## üöÄ Features
- **Data Cleaning**  
  - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formatting.  
  - Converted percentages and text values into usable numeric formats.  
  - Created calculated columns for deeper analysis (e.g., ratios, age groups).  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Used **pivot tables** to summarize key metrics.  
  - Identified patterns and trends across categories, time periods, and groups.  

- **Visualization**  
  - Designed interactive charts (bar, column, line, pie, and combo charts).  
  - Used **conditional formatting** for better readability of KPIs.  
  - Applied **slicers and filters** to allow dynamic exploration.  

- **Dashboard Creation**  
  - Built a **single-page dashboard** for executives.  
  - Included key performance indicators (KPIs) such as totals, averages, and growth trends.  
  - Enabled **drill-down** into specific categories.
